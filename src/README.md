## Installing on Mobile
1. For mobile，you'll need a browser that supports scripts.  I've succesfully used [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_US).
2. From Kiwi Browser, install the [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) extension
3. You will probably also want to use [Full Screen Button](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-screen-button/iokdoigdonjidoklkaonhielnkamibnp) extension to remove the sidebar while playing
4. After installing the extensions，download the script: https://github.com/snowyivu/ShinyColors/raw/gh-pages/ShinyColors.user.js ，tampermonkey should prompt you to load it
5. Refresh the game page and the patch should work automatically
